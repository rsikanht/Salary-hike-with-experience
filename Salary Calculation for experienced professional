25792.20+9450.0*4

# From the provided data set, the correlation value is 0.98 and hence both variables are strong and positively correlated.
# Co-ef. are significant and co-ef.of Determination value. i.e R^2 is 0.96 which is good.
# sum of errors is -7.844392e-12 i.e approx 0 and errors are equally distributed.
# Hence model is best fit and experience is an appropriate input to determine salary hike.
